Here’s a list of golden rules for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that can help you decide which data structure or algorithm to use in common situations:

### 1. **Sorted Array → Use Binary Search**
   - **Why**: Binary search is optimal for searching in a sorted array with a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
   - **Use Case**: Find an element in a sorted array.

### 2. **Unsorted Collection → Use Linear Search**
   - **Why**: In unsorted collections, binary search is not applicable, so linear search with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) is your best option.
   - **Use Case**: Search for an element in an unsorted array or list.

### 3. **Dynamic Data with Frequent Inserts/Deletes → Use Linked List**
   - **Why**: Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion operations with a time complexity of \(O(1)\) if you have a reference to the node.
   - **Use Case**: Implement dynamic data storage like stacks and queues.

### 4. **Need Fast Access by Index → Use Array**
   - **Why**: Arrays provide constant-time \(O(1)\) access to elements if you know the index.
   - **Use Case**: When you need to access elements frequently by index.

### 5. **Frequent Searches and Inserts → Use Hash Table**
   - **Why**: Hash tables provide average-case \(O(1)\) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.
   - **Use Case**: When fast access, insertions, and deletions are needed, like in caches or dictionaries.

### 6. **Sorted Data with Fast Insertions and Deletions → Use Binary Search Tree (BST)**
   - **Why**: BSTs allow you to maintain sorted data and perform search, insert, and delete operations with an average time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
   - **Use Case**: Maintaining dynamic sorted data with balanced tree structures like AVL or Red-Black trees for efficient operations.

### 7. **Optimal Search in Graphs → Use BFS/DFS**
   - **Why**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are optimal for traversing or searching through graph structures.
   - **Use Case**: Use BFS for shortest path in unweighted graphs; DFS for exploring deep paths or connected components.

### 8. **Finding Shortest Path in Weighted Graph → Use Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
   - **Why**: Dijkstra's algorithm is optimal for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights with time complexity \(O(E + V \log V)\) (using a priority queue).
   - **Use Case**: Navigation systems, network routing.

### 9. **Need Constant-Time Min/Max → Use Heap**
   - **Why**: Heaps (priority queues) allow you to access the minimum or maximum element in constant time \(O(1)\) and perform insertions/deletions in \(O(\log n)\).
   - **Use Case**: Efficiently manage dynamic priority-based tasks, like scheduling or event handling.

### 10. **Recursion with Overlapping Subproblems → Use Dynamic Programming**
   - **Why**: Dynamic programming solves overlapping subproblems by storing intermediate results to avoid recomputation.
   - **Use Case**: Problems like Fibonacci series, Knapsack, or Longest Common Subsequence.

### 11. **Need to Find K-th Largest/Smallest → Use Quickselect/Heaps**
   - **Why**: Quickselect has an average time complexity of \(O(n)\), while a min/max heap can provide efficient \(O(k \log k)\) performance.
   - **Use Case**: Finding the median or any \(k\)-th order statistic.

### 12. **Fixed Size Sliding Window Problem → Use Deque (Double-ended Queue)**
   - **Why**: Deques allow efficient insertion and removal from both ends in constant time, making it useful for sliding window techniques.
   - **Use Case**: Maximum or minimum in a sliding window.

### 13. **Graph with Negative Weights → Use Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - **Why**: Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative weights, unlike Dijkstra’s algorithm.
   - **Use Case**: Finding shortest paths in graphs where some edges have negative weights.

### 14. **Cycle Detection in Graphs → Use DFS or Union-Find**
   - **Why**: DFS can detect cycles in directed or undirected graphs, and the Union-Find (disjoint-set) can detect cycles in undirected graphs.
   - **Use Case**: Detecting cycles in network connections or dependencies.

### 15. **Backtracking Problem → Use Recursive DFS**
   - **Why**: Backtracking problems, like solving a maze, Sudoku, or generating permutations, can be efficiently solved using recursive DFS.
   - **Use Case**: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), combinatorics.

### 16. **Need Real-Time Median Calculation → Use Two Heaps**
   - **Why**: Using a min-heap and a max-heap allows real-time median calculation in \(O(\log n)\).
   - **Use Case**: Real-time data analysis, streaming applications.

### 17. **Longest Increasing Subsequence → Use Binary Search with DP**
   - **Why**: A combination of binary search and dynamic programming yields \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity for the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem.
   - **Use Case**: LIS problem in sequence-based optimizations.

### 18. **Heavy Use of Range Queries → Use Segment Trees/Fenwick Trees**
   - **Why**: Segment trees and Fenwick trees (Binary Indexed Trees) provide efficient updates and queries on ranges with \(O(\log n)\) time complexity.
   - **Use Case**: Range sum queries, minimum/maximum range queries.

### 19. **Sorting Large Data Efficiently → Use Merge Sort or Quick Sort**
   - **Why**: Merge Sort guarantees \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity, while Quick Sort is \(O(n \log n)\) on average and can be faster with good pivot selection.
   - **Use Case**: Sorting data sets efficiently, especially when space or time is a concern.

### 20. **Graph Traversal for Unweighted Shortest Path → BFS**
   - **Why**: BFS traverses levels in the shortest way in unweighted graphs, ensuring the shortest path in terms of edges.
   - **Use Case**: Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, social networks.
